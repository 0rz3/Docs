#### **I have found a bug or an exploit what should I do?**

If the issue is code related and you know how to use Github, create a new "Issue" in the appropriate repository on our [GitHub](https://github.com/BeamMP). We use an issue-based workflow so even if you already have a fix for the bug, consider opening a new "Issue", then asking a "Pull Request" that solves your "Issue". More info on contributing can be found [here](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md).
