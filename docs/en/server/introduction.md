# Introduction

If running your own BeamMP Server is something you want to do then there is a question I have to ask for you.

Do you want to host the server yourself or have someone manage it for you so you can get right into the action?

If you want to get to the action then please check out our hosting providers over at our [forum](https://forum.beammp.com/c/server-hosting/5).

If however you with to setup the server yourself and handle all the magic that has to happen in order to get your server running then you will need to check out this guide [here](https://docs.beammp.com/server/create-a-server/).
