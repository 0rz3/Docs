Basics of setting up the server application

## **Overview**
#### **Making a server for BeamMP is simple and free!**

Servers are an integral part of BeamMP; players are connected to each other through the server. They run natively on Windows and Linux.

You can make private servers, which only people you invite can join, or public servers, which will show in our official server list. To invite someone simply give them the IP and Port of the server and they can join through Direct Connect.

Getting a server up and running is a process with a few steps! It's quite easy, but if you run into any issues, feel free to ask on our [Forum](https://forum.beammp.com) or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/beammp) in the `#server-support channel`. Also refer to the [Server Manual](/en/server/server-manual) section for more info.
