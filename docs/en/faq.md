List of commonly asked questions and known bugs

## **Client**

---
#### **How do I install BeamMP?**

There is a full guide on how to install BeamMP on Windows, you can find it [here](/en/installation).

---
#### **Does BeamMP work on a cracked version of BeamNG?**

BeamMP does not work with cracked versions or outdated versions of BeamNG.drive. If you want to use BeamMP please consider buying the game.

---
#### **Does BeamMP work on linux?**

The Client is not officially  supported on Linux. However, you might be able to get it working by running the launcher in the same proton prefix as the game.

The Server builds can be found in the `BeamMP_Server.zip` download on the [Official Website](https://beammp.com/), or in the [releases tab on the Github](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/releases). For building instructions see [here](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/releases).

#### **Why is the launcher flagged by my antivirus or by Windows Defender**

In order to prevent Windows Defender from flagging a specific .exe, we need to buy a license which is very expensivr, therefor, BeamMP might get flagged by Windows Defender

Some antivirus may flag BeamMP as a virus  beacause it does some interactions with network and other stuff. There are **no viruses** in any of the code. The code for the launcher, server, and lua client can be seen on our [GitHub](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/releases).

---
#### **I have poor performance, what should I do?**

We are working hard to make performance as good as possible. Sadly, there isn't a lot you can do about it, if you have already lowered your graphic settings and your performance is still poor, consider playing on a server with less players. The game is mainly CPU bound when you play with lots of people, so older CPUs (even quadcores) will suffer with more than a handful of people.
