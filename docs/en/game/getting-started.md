# Getting Started

---
## **Before getting started**
BeamMP is only compatible with legitimate, Steam versions of the game. "Cracked" copies are not supported.

---
## **Windows Installation**
1. Go to our [Official Website](https://beammp.com/) and download the latest `BeamMP_Installer.zip` by clicking the green, "Download Client" button.
2. Open the `BeamMP_Installer.zip` archive.
3. Launch `BeamMP_Installer.exe` and follow the instructions.
4. The BeamMP Launcher icon should appear on your desktop. If not, just search for “BeamMP” in the windows search bar. Afterwards you should see a little black window appear, shortly after BeamNG.drive should start.
5. Once BeamNG launches, press “Play”. In the main menu you should see “Multiplayer” and from there you can play BeamMP.
6. You will be prompted with a login pop-up, you can either play as a guest (not all servers will allow guests), or create an account on our [Forum](https://forum.beammp.com) and then login to BeamMP with your credentials.
7. Select any server you like, and press “Connect”. Enjoy!

Just to note, as you are loading into a map with multiple vehicles spawned it might take longer than expected to join.

## **Known Issues**
If you don’t see the “Multiplayer” button. Make sure that the BeamMP mod is activated in the “Mod Manager” then try pressing CTRL + L.

It's also important that BeamMP is the **only** mod activated in the “Mod Manager” as otherwise this can cause issues.

If you need further help with installation, you are welcome to create a post on our [Forum](https://forum.beammp.com) or ask in the [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/beammp)
